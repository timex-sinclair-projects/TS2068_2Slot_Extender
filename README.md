# TS2068_2Slot_Extender
These files are for a two slot extender board for the TS-2068. It is intended for people who want a shorter extension board but with the same functionality as the four slot version.

The _AltiumFiles.zip contains all of the Altium project files. These should import into any of the Altium tools.
The _BuildFiles.zip contains the Schematics, Gerber files, Drill files and BOM for the board. The Gerber and drill files can be used by an PCB house to fabricate the PCBs. The schematics can be viewed in the ts2068Extender.PDF file.

As of 28Dec2023 the design has not been fabricated and tested.
